            <div>
                <p> Hey! I'm Franco Velasco, a Computer Science student in Ateneo de Manila, a university in the Philippines. I have a keen interest in all things technology, and I'm always excited to learn about and help build the next big thing! </p>
                <p> My interest in technology started when I got my very first iPod touch back when iOS didn't even support home screen wallpapers, yet I was incredibly intrigued by the power contained within. Since then, I've always been interested in software, and how it's developed!</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p> Because of my experience with my iPod Touch, I'm mainly interested in mobile software development and all the possibility that platform has! Beyond that, I'm also interested in Web Development, Data Science, and whatever field in tech holds potential to make life a little bit better for all of us.</p>
                <p> Beyond mindlessly coding in front of a screen for a few hours, I love to cook and catch up on some of my favorite things to watch over on YouTube and Netflix. </p>
