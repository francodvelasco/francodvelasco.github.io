      <div class="policy" id="yourData">
        <h2> Your Data </h2>
        <p> 
          Magnate takes your privacy very seriously. None of the data you input into Magnate gets sent to anyone without your consent
          -- not to a server, not to Apple, not to the developer. It does not get passed around or sold to any person or organization. Magnate is designed such that all features that could work offline,
          does work offline, allowing you to use Magnate privately wherever you may go.
        </p>
        <p> 
          All features and views that process your data (such as those presented in the Statistics and Projection) are processed entirely on-device. With a few exceptions outlined below, none of your data gets processed on any server.
        </p>
        <p>
          Features that require communication with the Internet (such as the Currency Conversion and Placemark features) only send the information required
          to process your request. For instance, the Currency Conversion feature only sends the local currency your device and the foreign currency you have
          selected to the server processing currency conversion requests -- nothing else. No data gets sent over the Internet or to any server without your 
          intervention first; the currencies will not be sent to the conversion API without you selecting a custom currency, for example.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Cloud Syncing feature utilizes iCloud to store your data, which means that if you choose to sync your data as such, it will get stored on Apple's servers, bound by their own privacy policy. 
          Apple does say that all data (which includes entries, goals, tags, profiles, and more from Magnate) stored on their servers are encrypted end-to-end and is locked by multiple layers of security measures -- however, the Cloud Syncing feature is opt-in, meaning that if you do not wish to have your data stored in Apple's servers, no work is required on your end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Magnate allows you to tag entries with the current location of the device. Magnate will only track your location at that specific instance, and will
          immediately stop requesting for a location once a valid one has been found. Magnate will not track your location without your specific consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          To assist in troubleshooting, Magnate will take logs of your activity, though these logs are anonymous; the logs do not contain any identifying or
          personal information whatsoever. These logs are securely stored on-device, and only get sent to the developer should you send an email containing a bug report
          You can delete these logs at anytime within the Settings view.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the Location and Placemark features utilize Apple Maps, by using these features, you (obviously) agree to be bound by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/"> Apple's Privacy Policy</a> (though by using your iOS device,
          you agree to abide and follow those terms.)
        </p>

      <div class="policy" id="externalLinks">
        <h2> External Links </h2>
        <p> 
          Certain features of this app may lead to an external link on the Internet, or to another app on your device. By opening any external link and 
          leaving Magnate, you agree to be bound by their own privacy policy and any other Terms and Conditions they are governed under.
